Analysis of Charging Events

Customer Parking Duration After Charging

Calculate the extra time a customer remains parked after the completion of the charging event.
Utilize 'Charging Time' and 'Total Duration' columns to determine how long the vehicle stayed beyond charging.
Percentage of Charge Events with Vehicles Parked After Charging

Identify instances where the vehicle remains parked post-charging.
Calculate the percentage of such events based on charging portlevel types.
Use 'Port Type' and 'Level Type' columns for categorization.
Average Extra Charging Time Across Events

Calculate the average extra time vehicles spend parked after charging.
Aggregate the 'Extra Time' across all events and compute the mean.
Explore variations based on different parameters like charging port type or location.
Data Preprocessing Steps

Data Cleaning

Ensure 'Start Date' and 'End Date' are in datetime format.
Convert time-related columns ('Start Time Zone', 'End Time Zone') for uniformity.
Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Visualization

Utilize graphs or charts to visualize the distribution of extra charging time.
Plot charging events over time or by location for insights.
Aggregations

Aggregate data based on charging portlevel types.
Calculate statistics for each category, such as average extra charging time.
Further Analysis

Explore correlations with other factors like 'City', 'Plug Type', or 'Country'.
Consider temporal patterns, e.g., variations in extra charging time during specific hours or days.
