# Data Analysis Competition Solution

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for Project Competition at SAMPARKâ€™24 held at Nirma University, Ahmedabad. Where participants were tasked with analyzing a given dataset and presenting their findings within a strict time limit of 2 hours. Our solution achieved 3rd place in the competition.

SAMPARK is an annual event conducted by the IEEE Gujarat Section where all the student branches across Gujarat get a platform to connect, develop, explore, and grow. 

## Competition Details
- **Theme**: Modern Solutions For a Greener Future 
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Rank Achieved**: 3rd place

## Dataset
The dataset provided for the competition is included in the `dataset/` directory.

## Code
The analysis was performed using Python language. Participants had to write code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, statistical analysis, and visualization within the 2-hour time frame.

## Analysis
The analysis includes various techniques such as:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Statistical Analysis
- Visualization

## Visualization
The visualizations generated from the analysis are available in the `visualization/` directory. These include charts, and graphs that helped in understanding the data and presenting key insights.

## Explanation
A detailed explanation of the code and analysis approach is provided in the `solution/` directory. It covers the methodologies used, challenges faced, and insights gained during the analysis process.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries for the execution of the code..
